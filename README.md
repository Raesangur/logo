# Logo
This repository contains various representations of my logo, a mix of a `m` and a `1`.
The various versions have been generated from the `m1.svg` file, with different layers displayed or not to achieve the different versions.
In addition to the graphical versions, a font is available as well to import the logo in various programs.

The color palette is <span style="color: #000000"> #0000000 </span> for the pure black and <span style="color:#AA0000"> #AA0000 </span> for the red.

`.png` pictures have been exported for each variant of the logo, in three available resolutions, a low-res `256x256`, a `512x512` and a high-res `2048x2048`.


### Clouds
The regular version of the logo, that I use in 99% of cases. The logo has no transparency and features clouds in the background.
This version might be heavy to use as a `.svg` due to the clouds, and using the high-res `.png` version could be better in some cases.

# Font
The file `font.ttf` is a TrueType font generated by icomoon.io from the `font.svg` file.
It can be useful to import the black & white, outlined, logo in different programs (notaby CAD software such as Altium Designer) as a font.
As a font, the logo can be scaled easily to any size.

This font contains a single changed character the `m` (`0x6d`) character.
The font is called `m1` on the file system, and I have licensed it under the GNU Public License 3 (GPLv3) like everything else in this repo.

You might need to restart your program for it to refresh its font list after installation.
In certain programs, such as Word, using any other character than `m` will reset the select font to the default document's font.


# Available formats
In addition to the `.png` files, various other formats have also been generated for each variant.

## Vector graphics
`.svg` and `.pdf` pictures have also been exported as vector graphics.
`.pdf` pictures were generated with a 600dpi resolution.
The `.svg` subversions were created from the main `m1.svg`, with unused layers cleaned off, and can be used as vector images directly, to regenerate the `.pdf` files or to generate other formats such as `.html` or `.tex` versions which have not been included in this repository.

## Icons
`.ico` files have been generated for each of the variants. The icons contain a 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128 and 256x256 version, with 32-bits colors (24 for colors and 8 for transparency), combined into a single `.ico` picture with https://www.icoconverter.com/
